# Powersensor integration for Home Assistant

This is the official [Powersensor](https://www.powersensor.com.au) integration
for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), enabling automation based
on the Powersensor data.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://dius.github.io/homeassistant-powersensor/) for details, including installation instructions (if not installing via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz)).

[Troubleshooting](https://dius.github.io/homeassistant-powersensor/troubleshooting.html) documentation is also available there, though hopefully not needed.

Automate away, and if you do something cool we'd love to hear about it!

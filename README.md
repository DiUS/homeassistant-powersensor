# Powersensor integration for Home Assistant

This is the official [Powersensor](https://www.powersensor.com.au) integration
for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), enabling automation based
on the Powersensor data.

This integration connects directly to the plugs and does not rely on the cloud
API, and as such does not depend on uninterrupted Internet connectivity. This
should offer the best reliability for automations. (The Powersensor devices
still require at least intermittent Internet connectivity to function properly.)

There is [documentation](https://dius.github.io/homeassistant-powersensor/)
provided, covering what data is being made available as well as
installation instructions (if not installing via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz)).

Automate away, and if you do something cool we'd love to hear about it!
